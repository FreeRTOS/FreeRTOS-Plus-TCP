/*
 * How to catch an assert:
 * - save a jump buffer where execution will resume after the assert
 * - setup a handler for the abort signal, call longjmp within
 * - optional - close stderr ( fd 2 ) to discard the assert message
 *
 * Unity also does a longjmp within its TEST_ASSERT* macros,
 * so the macro below restores stderr and the prior abort handler
 * before calling the Unity macro.
